# Git Usage in Replit Environment

## The Issue
Replit sometimes creates git lock files that prevent command-line git operations. This is normal and here are the solutions:

## Solution 1: Use Replit's Built-in Git Interface (Recommended)

1. **Open Git Panel**: Click the Git icon in the left sidebar
2. **Stage Changes**: Click the "+" next to files you want to commit
3. **Write Commit Message**: Enter your message in the commit box
4. **Commit & Push**: Click "Commit" then "Push" 

## Solution 2: Use Shell Tab (Alternative)

1. **Open New Shell**: Click the "+" tab next to Console and select "Shell"
2. **Run Git Commands**: Now you can use the automation scripts:
   ```bash
   ./autocommit.sh "Your commit message"
   git ac "Your message"
   ./quick-commit.sh "Your message"
   ```

## Solution 3: Manual Git Commands

If automation scripts don't work, use basic git commands in the Shell tab:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## Available Automation Scripts

Even if command-line git has issues, the scripts are ready for when you have terminal access:

- `./autocommit.sh "message"` - Full auto-commit
- `./quick-commit.sh "message"` - Quick commit
- `git ac "message"` - Git alias (if set up)
- `git qc "message"` - Quick commit alias

## Current Changes Ready to Commit

The following new files are ready to be committed:
- Git automation scripts (autocommit.sh, quick-commit.sh, setup-git-automation.sh)
- Updated README.md with complete documentation
- replit-git-guide.md (this file)

## Recommendation

Use Replit's built-in Git interface for now - it's the most reliable method in this environment.
